# Data-Driven-Analysis-of-Vertical-Motions-in-Milky-Way-Stars

The Radcliffe Wave (RW) is a recently discovered sinusoidal vertical feature of dense gas near the Sun, aligned with the Local Arm of the Milky Way. However, the origin of its vertical oscillation remains unclear. This project applies statistical analysis and N-body simulations to study the kinematics of the RW using young stars and open clusters as tracers.

We analyze vertical velocity trends along and beyond the RW, revealing a distinct kinematic wave in the Milky Way. Our results show that the amplitude of oscillation depends on the age of the stellar population, suggesting a complex dynamical history. By comparing our findings with N-body simulations, we investigate whether a satellite galaxy—similar in mass to the Sagittarius dwarf—could have triggered this kinematic feature. While the RW aligns with a spiral density wave induced by the satellite interaction, the observed kinematic wave exhibits a radial propagation pattern, raising new questions about its origin.

This study leverages large-scale astronomical datasets, statistical modeling, and N-body simulations to explore the dynamics of the Galactic disk. Future Gaia data releases (DR3 & DR4) may provide further constraints on these kinematic structures, potentially confirming the existence of a predicted vertical velocity dipole.
